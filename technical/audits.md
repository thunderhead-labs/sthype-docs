# Audits

## Protocol

Smart contracts have been audited by top tier industry auditors. Our system is highly modular and components are reused across all of our LSTs. Core functionality and design premises have thus undergone multiple audits across the portfolio.\
\
The latest audit is by industry leading [Three Sigma](https://threesigma.xyz).&#x20;

View all of our audits on [github](https://github.com/thunderhead-labs/audits).

stHYPE and Thunderhead take security very seriously, follow best in class smart contract security and infrastructure practices across the board.

## Governance

FraxGovernorOmega from Frax's "FraxGov" has been implemented with a handful of trivial [modifications](https://github.com/thunderhead-labs/frax-governance). FraxGovernorOmega is currently live on mainnet and has significant TVL associated with it. The system was[ audited by Trail of Bits](https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2023-05-fraxgov-securityreview.pdf).
