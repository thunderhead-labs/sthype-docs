# Security

The stHYPE protocol will hold a significant portion of HYPE supply. It is imperative that the system is maximally secure.

### **Simplicity**

The protocol is built with simplicity in mind. We intentionally simplify mechanisms to reduce the risk of vulnerability. We do not use any complex math and we segment out components of the protocol to reduce the impact of a possible vulnerability. Liquid staking is an order of magnitude simpler mechanism than lending markets or AMMs which significantly increases the safety of user deposits.

### Audits <a href="#governance-overview" id="governance-overview"></a>

Security is top of mind with 100% test coverage and deep fuzz/invariant testing. We also work with top-tier auditors to ensure that the code is bug-free.

One of our co-founders found a $6m vulnerability in Curve and [white-hatted it](https://addison.is/posts/curve-whitehat) so we take security very seriously.&#x20;

### Governance <a href="#governance-overview" id="governance-overview"></a>

stHYPE is both an LST and also a governance token, this means the larger the holding of stHYPE, the bigger say you'll get on proposals. **staked hype** is one of the first LSTs to have rights in governance matters.\
\
This ensures that holders and users remain in control of the protocol.

### How Governance Works <a href="#governance-overview" id="governance-overview"></a>

When the governance multisig signers submit proposals, they correspond on the backend to Gnosis Safe transactions. Such proposals can then be either **approved** or **vetoed** by stHYPE holders. These proposals are optimistic, meaning that they succeed by default (unless quorum is met and they are vetoed). See our governance section for more detail! This system will go live post Hyperliquid pre-compiles.

## Vulnerability Reporting

If you find a vulnerability across any of our services, please reach out immediately to our team. We have deep [white-hat experience](https://addison.is/posts/curve-whitehat), and thus we understand optimal bounty and disclosure processes.

You can reach us by making a ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/thunderhead), messaging us on [Telegram](https://t.me/thundercove), or contacting us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thunderheadwrld). Depending on the severity you might want to try multiple channels at once. You can also [message](https://t.me/addisonthunderhead) our CEO directly.
