# stHYPE Integration Guide

This guide provides information on how to integrate with the `stHYPE` protocol using our smart contracts, indexed api and other relevant resources.

## Smart Contracts

For more detailed information on the `stHYPE` integration, please refer to the [stHYPE Integration Details](guides/smart-contracts.md).


### Deployed Contract Addresses

- stHYPE: [0x18b2569896e7a7880b00f82212f2a3d9374f5b0f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x18b2569896e7a7880b00f82212f2a3d9374f5b0f)
- overseerV1: [0x18b2569896e7a7880b00f82212f2a3d9374f5b0f](https://etherscan.io/address/0x18b2569896e7a7880b00f82212f2a3d9374f5b0f)


### ABIs

ABIs for the smart contracts are available in the [src/abis](src/abis) folder.

## Code Examples

Frontend code examples on how to implement staking and unstaking are available in the [src/examples](src/examples) folder.

## Indexer API

A hosted GraphQL playground for indexed data at [https://index-testnet.stakedhype.fi/graphql](https://index-testnet.stakedhype.fi/graphql).

Please note this is still under development and the data may not be fully accurate or stable until mainnet launch.


## Additonal Notes

The `stHYPE` protocol is almost complete but some aspects may change before mainnet launch once Hyperliquid reveals their minting schedule.

This guide will be updated to reflect any changes and partners will be notified of any updates when they occur.
