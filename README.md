# stHYPE Integration

This repo provides information on how to integrate with the `stHYPE` protocol using our smart contracts, index api and other relevant resources.

## Smart Contracts

For more detailed information on the `stHYPE` integration, please refer to the [Integration Guide](guides).


### Deployed Contract Addresses

Refer to the [docs](https://docs.stakedhype.fi/technical/contract-addresses) for latest on testnet.

#### ABIs

ABIs for the smart contracts are available in the [src/abis](src/abis) folder.

## Code Examples

Frontend code examples on how to implement staking and unstaking are available in the [src/examples](src/examples) folder.

## Indexer API

A hosted GraphQL playground for indexed data at [https://index.stakedhype.fi/graphql](https://index-testnet.stakedhype.fi/graphql).

Please note this is still under development and the data may not be fully accurate or stable until mainnet launch.

## Data API

Data API will provide APR and historical protocol data.

Coming soon. 

## Community Codes

These will be whitelisted at the smart contract level for approved partners.

These are passed as a param to the staking and unstaking functions in order to track HYPE flow and rewards throughout the ecosystem.

## Additonal Notes

The `stHYPE` protocol is almost complete but some aspects may change before mainnet launch once Hyperliquid reveals their minting schedule.

This guide will be updated to reflect any changes and partners will be notified of any updates when they occur.

## White label solution

Coming soon
