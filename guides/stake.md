How Does stHYPE Work?

When a user converts native HYPE to stHYPE, that HYPE is sent to staking contracts which programmatically mint an equivalent amount of stHYPE to the sender's address.&#x20;

This native HYPE is staked onto validator nodes that earn protocol rewards for validating the Hyperliquid Network.&#x20;

stHYPE always represents native HYPE 1:1, and will accrue these protocol rewards in the form of a rebase, meaning that rewards will automatically accrue to the holder's wallet.

## Step 1:  Connect Your Wallet

Our staking supports most major wallets including hardware wallets.

As stHYPE resides on Hyperliquid EVM, you'll need to make sure you are on the correct network in order to view it within your wallet. The website will prompt you to connect.

## Step 2: Select Amount and Send Transaction

Input the amount of HYPE that you would like to stake (this is the amount of native HYPE you will swap for stHYPE). Users can stake any amount of HYPE and there is no maximum. The underlying value will always be 1:1 but the since stHYPE is yield bearing the native token amount will be less, please pay attention to the exchange rate.

Click '**Stake'**, then confirm the transaction in your wallet.

## Step 3: **Receive stHYPE**&#x20;

You just staked your HYPE !&#x20;

Once your HYPE is sent, you will automatically receive stHYPE in your wallet when the transaction completes.&#x20;

## **Step 4: Earn Rewards**&#x20;

Protocol rewards earned from validator nodes will accrue automatically. stHYPE uses a rebase mechanism to allow balances to increase in line with protocol rewards.

You are now helping secure the Hyperliquid ecosystem and getting the rewards for doing so.
