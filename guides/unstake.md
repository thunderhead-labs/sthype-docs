# Unstake

## What happens when you unstake?

When you unstake your stHYPE  you exchange it for native HYPE.

For e.g, if you originally staked 1000 HYPE, you'll have received around 1000 stHYPE (perhaps slightly more due to the defi aggregation). If you held your stHYPE for a year and earned 50% in rewards, your balance will now be 1500 stHYPE. When you unstake the stHYPE, you'll receive back 1500 native HYPE.\

If you are unsure or do not understand this process, please reach out to our team on our [Telegram community](https://t.me/thundercove/33737), our website (contact us) or in our [discord server.](https://discord.gg/thunderhead)  If you are ever uncertain, spend the time to reach out to our team.  Please be 110% confident, you are aware of the process and understand all risks associated with staking. &#x20;

## Step 1: Connect your Wallet

Just like when staking, the first step is to connect your wallet. The site use supports most major wallets including hardware wallets.

Once your wallet is connected, the '**Connect Wallet'** button will change to '**Approve'**. Users will need to approve their stHYPE for spending via a transaction before they are able to use the '**Submit'** button.

## Step 2: Approve and Submit Unstake

When unstaking stHYPE, users need to approve the amount with the unstaking contract. Once approved, enter how much stHYPE you would like to unstake for native HYPE.

If the unstake contract has sufficient HYPE, the unstake will be instant, and you will receive your HYPE immediately.

If there isn't enough HYPE in the pool for an immediate unstake, you will have to wait until HYPE is unstaked from hyperliquid validators within the protocol. This is a Hyperliquid protocol constraint and cannot be circumvented.\
\
&#xNAN;_**In the coming days and weeks after we integrate with additional DeFI protocols, we will be offering an "instant unstake" button in odrer to sell current stHYPE into a liquidity pool for native HYPE.  If this option is taken, there may be a difference in the amount of HYPE received due to slippage on the open market.**_

## Step 4: Receive HYPE

Upon unstaking, you will receive native HYPE. Note that native HYPE does not rebase like stHYPE, and you will no longer accrue rewards from validator nodes.
