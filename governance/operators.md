# Operators

Elite operators are a vital component of stHYPE in order to give users the most competitive rewards available.\
\
stHYPE operators are selected based on their alignment with the Hyperliquid / stHYPE ecosystem, performance metrics, and security practices. When the protocol launches, stHYPE holders will have the opportunity to vote on whether an operator should be included in the set. From there, stake distribution is determined as function of performance score and stake contribution to stHYPE.\
