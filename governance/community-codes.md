# Community Codes

Onboarded operators are eligible for a community code. Please see the onboarding and governance process [here ](overview.md)and [here](operator-onboarding.md).

Operators are able to include stHYPE staking into their interfaces. Community codes are codes included in user stake transactions (see technical details [here](../technical/integrate.md)).

Stake attributed via community code is delegated to the respective validator. This allows operators to easily support stHYPE because they directly benefit from stake they refer.  Additionally, a portion of the global pool (stake contributed via the main frontend or directly onchain) is distributed pro-rata amongst community code stake. This creates incentive alignment for validators to push users to stake through their community code rather than delegation because they will receive the same direct delegation in addition to a greater share of the global pool.

The remainder of the global pool will be allocated based on performance metrics. Regardless of stake amount, all operators are held to an extremely high performance standard, as decided by onchain metrics. In the event that an operator falters, Thunderhead and other operators will attempt to provide advice to remedy performance. If performance does not improve, they will be removed from the set.&#x20;

Please reach out if you are interested in operating a Community Code. To integrate community codes into your frontend, see our [integrate.md](../technical/integrate.md "mention") page.
