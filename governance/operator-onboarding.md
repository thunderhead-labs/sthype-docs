# Operator Onboarding

There is no bias in validator selection - any operator with sufficient security practices and performance should be able to join the set, subject to stHYPE voters.\
\
If you are interested in becoming an operator for stHYPE, feel free to reach out to us on twitter, telegram or email and we can begin discussions. You will need to fill out this [form](https://forms.gle/L5QxnfrNgtnyKnFL9) outlining the technical details of your operation. This will be replaced by a public forum process after the HyperEVM is released.&#x20;

Inclusion is ultimately decided by stHYPE holders. We recommend that they evaluate based on the following non-exhaustive dimensions.

1. Security. How does the operator store their validator keys? Who has access? Where are the backups? How are the machines networked? How are keys created and destroyed?&#x20;
2. Monitoring. How are validators monitored? How redundant? What metrics do you track?&#x20;
3. Track record. What has your team built? What is your TVD? Have you been slashed in the past?
4. Ecosystem alignment. What have you done for Hyperliquid? Do you support the ecosystem with open source tooling, content, or something else?&#x20;
5. Infrastructure. Where do you run infrastructure? Bare metal or cloud?&#x20;
6. Deployment. How are upgrades processed? What do you use to deploy and manage the validator software?
